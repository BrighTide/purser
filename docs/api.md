## Providers

Create a connection to an Ethereum blockchain. This is achieved differently by the various providers.

HTTP API endpoint for _etherscan_ and _infura_, injected into the webpage in the case of _metamask_, or local RPC connection in the case of _localhost_.

### `etherscan`

```js
etherscan([network: string], [token: string])
```

This provider method takes an optional `network` name as string _(defaults to 'homestead')_ and an optional, but very recommended `token` -- without it the connection will still work but will be very limited. A new token for the Etherscan API can be generated [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

```js
import { etherscan } from 'colony-wallet/providers';

const provider = etherscan('homestead', '<your-token-key>'); // { chainId: '', ensAddress: '', ... }

```

### `infura`

```js
infura([network: string], [token: string])
```

This provider method takes an optional `network` name as string _(defaults to 'homestead')_ and an optional, but very recommended `token` -- without it the connection will still work but will be very limited. A new token for the Infura API can be generated by [signing up for the service](https://infura.io/signup).

```js
import { infura } from 'colony-wallet/providers';

const provider = infura('homestead', '<your-token-key>'); // { chainId: '', ensAddress: '', ... }
```
