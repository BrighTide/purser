# API

These docs serve to outline the API format and methods provided by `colony-wallet`.

#### Console output

In `development` mode there will be a number of warnings or errors outputted verbosely to the console.

When building with `NODE_ENV=production` all output will be silenced.

## Providers

Create a connection to an Ethereum blockchain. This is achieved differently by the various providers.

HTTP API endpoint for _etherscan_ and _infura_, injected into the webpage in the case of _metamask_, or local RPC connection in the case of _localhost_.

### `metamask`

```js
metamask([network: string])
```

This provider method takes just an optional `network` name as string _(defaults to 'homestead')_ and will use the in-page `Web3` provider injected by the [Metamask extension](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension), if available.

```js
import { metamask } from 'colony-wallet/providers';

const provider = metamask('homestead'); // { chainId: '', ensAddress: '', ... }

// Or just use the defaults if you just want to go on mainnet.
const providerDefaults = metamask();
```

### `etherscan`

```js
etherscan([network: string], [token: string])
```

This provider method takes an optional `network` name as string _(defaults to 'homestead')_ and an optional, but very recommended `token` -- without it the connection will still work but will be very limited. A new token for the Etherscan API can be generated [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

```js
import { etherscan } from 'colony-wallet/providers';

const provider = etherscan('homestead', '<your-token-key>'); // { chainId: '', ensAddress: '', ... }

```

### `infura`

```js
infura([network: string], [token: string])
```

This provider method takes an optional `network` name as string _(defaults to 'homestead')_ and an optional, but very recommended `token` -- without it the connection will still work but will be very limited. A new token for the Infura API can be generated by [signing up for the service](https://infura.io/signup).

```js
import { infura } from 'colony-wallet/providers';

const provider = infura('homestead', '<your-token-key>'); // { chainId: '', ensAddress: '', ... }
```

### `localhost`

```js
localhost([url: string], [network: string])
```

This provider method takes an optional `url` as string _(defaults to 'http://localhost:8545')_ and an optional `network` name as string _(defaults to 'homestead')_.

As opposed to the previous methods, this will just instantiate the provider but not actually connect to your local [`JSON-RPC`](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) server. It will only do that once you try sending a transaction. This also means that calling this method will never result in an error state, as any `url` string you provide will be initially instantiated -- when you try to communicate with it, than it will fail.

**Note:**

Most blockchain clients _(Parity, Geth)_ will restrict `JSON-RPC` connections by default via the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` request header, or in the case of _Geth_, won't even start it by default.

To be able to connect to them locally you'll have to add `--rpccorsdomain "<your-domain>"` _(in the case of Parity)_ or `--jsonrpc-cors "<your-domain>"` _(in the case of Geth)_ to your startup command. You can also use `*` as the domain name for both of them _(allowing connections from all domains)_ but that is less secure.

```js
import { localhost } from 'colony-wallet/providers';

const provider = localhost('http://localhost:8545', 'homestead'); // { chainId: '', ensAddress: '', ... }
```

### `autoselect`

```js
autoselect([providersList: Array<function|Object>])
```

This is just a helper method that goes through a list of providers _(both generator methods and already instantiated provider objects)_ and selects the first one available.

By default it goes through the following provider list, in order: `[metamask, etherscan, infura, localhost]`, so if this works for you, just call it directly without any arguments:

```js
import { autoselect } from 'colony-wallet/providers';

const provider = autoselect(); // This will return the first available, instantiated provider
```

Because it takes both generator methods and already-instantiated providers you can mix and match them:

```js
import { autoselect, metamask, localhost } from 'colony-wallet/providers';

const localFallback = localhost('http://localhost:8545', 'ropsten');

const provider = autoselect([() => metamask('ropsten'), localFallback]);
```

## Utils

A set of utility methods that are used throughout the library, but that are also exposed via the `utils` export for independent use.

### `getRandomValues`

```js
getRandomValues(typedArray: Uint8Array<>)
```

A polyfill for the [`Web Crypto API`s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) [`getRandomValues()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RandomSource/getRandomValues) method.

It checks for both implementations _(`webkit` or `ms`)_, and if it can't find any, it will try to polyfill it using node's [`crypto`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html) [`randomBytes`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randombytes_size_callback) method.

This method is used to provide randomness when creating a new wallet:
```js

import { software as wallet } from 'colony-wallet/wallet';
import { getRandomValues } from 'colony-wallet/utils';

// a bigger array is better, up to a max. of 65536 (the limit of the 8 bit unsigned array)

const uintArray = new Uint8Array(10); // [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

const entrophy = getRandomValues(uintArray); // [236, 157, 149, 236, 109, 233, 113, 151, 27, 93]

const newWallet = wallet.create({ entrophy });
```
